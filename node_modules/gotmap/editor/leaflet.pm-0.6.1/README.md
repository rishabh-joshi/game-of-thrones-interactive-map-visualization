# Leaflet Polygon Management
A Leaflet Plugin For Creating And Editing Geometry Layers in Leaflet 1.0

### Why *another* geometry editing plugin?
As leaflet.draw development seemed to came to a halt and I needed support for leaflet 1.0 beta (v2) I created this plugin myself due to a lack of alternatives.
As we are always using the latest leaflet version in a big production app, I will (have to) keep this plugin constantly developed.

#### [Demo](http://codeofsumit.github.io/leaflet.pm/)

### Getting Started

#### Install via Bower
`bower install leaflet.pm --save`

#### Install Manually
Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/codeofsumit/leaflet.pm/releases). Include `leaflet.pm.min.js` and `leaflet.pm.css` in your project.


#### Init Leaflet.PM
Just include `leaflet.pm.min.js` right after Leaflet.


##### Drawing Mode
Use Drawing Mode on a map like this


```

// enable drawing mode for shape - e.g. Poly
map.pm.enableDraw('Poly');

// get array of all available shapes (currently only Poly)
map.pm.getShapes();

// listen to when drawing mode gets enabled
map.on('pm:drawstart', function(e) {//...});


// disable drawing mode
map.pm.disableDraw('Poly');

// listen to when drawing mode gets disabled
map.on('pm:drawend', function(e) {//...});


// add a control button to the map which can toggle drawing mode for shapes
map.pm.addControls();

// listen to when a new layer is created
map.on('pm:create', function(e) {//...});

```


##### Edit Mode
Use Edit Mode for a layer like this:

```
var polygonLayer = L.geoJson(data).addTo(map);

// enable edit mode
polygonLayer.pm.enable();

// disable edit mode
polygonLayer.pm.disable();

// toggle edit mode
polygonLayer.pm.toggleEdit();

// check if edit mode is enabled
polygonLayer.pm.enabled(); // returns true/false

// listen to changes
polygonLayer.on('pm:edit', function(e) {//...});

```


### Credit
As I never built a leaflet plugin before, I looked heavily into the code of leaflet.draw to find out how to do stuff. So don't be suprised to see some familiar code.
